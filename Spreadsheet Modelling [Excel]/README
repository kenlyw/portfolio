It is imperative that Singapore achieve water self-sufficiency before the second Water Agreement expires in 2061. It is expected that total water demand will double by
2060. The project will consider supply side measures of how to increase supply from the other 3 water sources, while also considering demand factors affecting potable 
and non-potable water demand in Singapore.

This study will explore Singapore water needs, namely:
•	What is the increase of local water supply needed, to achieve 100% self-sufficiency in water supply by 2060?
•	Which source of local water supply should Singapore increase?
•	How will water demand change by 2060?

This model uses excel to model and compute what are Singapore's water needs by 2060
