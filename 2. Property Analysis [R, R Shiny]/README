This project explores the relationship between prices of properties and planning regions. Followed by exploration of the other two drivers of property prices: - 
(1) property types – apartment, condominiums, landed properties, and 
(2) tenure type – 99-year leasehold vs. freehold properties. 
(3) Lastly, purchaser profiles will be examined to understand the market profile for properties of different tenure types.
